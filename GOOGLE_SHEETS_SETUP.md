2. Click **"Select a project"** â†’ **"New Project"**
3. Enter a project name (e.g., "Sonham Group Website")
4. Click **"Create"**
5. Wait for the project to be created and select it

## Step 2: Enable Google Sheets API

3. Search for **"Google Sheets API"**
4. Click on it and click **"Enable"**
5. Wait for the API to be enabled

## Step 3: Create a Service Account

1. Go to **"APIs & Services"** â†’ **"Credentials"**
2. Click **"Create Credentials"** â†’ **"Service Account"**
3. Enter the following:
   - **Service account name**: `website-forms` (or any name you prefer)
   - **Service account ID**: Will auto-fill
   - **Description**: "Service account for website contact form"
4. Click **"Create and Continue"**
5. For the role, select **"Editor"** (or you can skip this step)
6. Click **"Continue"** and then **"Done"**

---

## Step 4: Create and Download Service Account Key

1. On the **Credentials** page, find your newly created service account in the **"Service Accounts"** section
2. Click on the service account email address
3. Go to the **"Keys"** tab
4. Click **"Add Key"** â†’ **"Create new key"**
5. Select **"JSON"** as the key type
6. Click **"Create"**
7. A JSON file will be downloaded to your computer
8. **IMPORTANT**: Keep this file secure! It contains sensitive credentials

---

## Step 5: Create Your Google Sheet

1. Go to [Google Sheets](https://sheets.google.com/)
2. Click **"Blank"** to create a new spreadsheet
3. Name it something like **"Sonham Group Contact Submissions"**
4. Copy the **Spreadsheet ID** from the URL:
   ```
   https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/YOUR_SPREADSHEET_ID/edit
   ```
   The ID is the long string between `/d/` and `/edit`

---

## Step 6: Share the Sheet with Your Service Account

1. In your Google Sheet, click the **"Share"** button (top right)
2. In the **"Add people and groups"** field, paste the service account email:
   - You can find this email in the JSON file you downloaded
   - It looks like: `website-forms@your-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
3. Give it **"Editor"** access
4. **UNCHECK** "Notify people" (it's an automated account, not a person)
5. Click **"Share"**

---

## Step 7: Set Up Environment Variables in Vercel

### Option A: Using Vercel Dashboard (Recommended)

1. Go to your project in [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Click on **"Settings"** â†’ **"Environment Variables"**
3. Add the following variables:

#### Variable 1: GOOGLE_SHEET_ID
- **Name**: `GOOGLE_SHEET_ID`
- **Value**: Paste your spreadsheet ID (from Step 5)
- **Environment**: Check all (Production, Preview, Development)

#### Variable 2: GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY
- **Name**: `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY`
- **Value**: 
  1. Open the JSON file you downloaded in Step 4
  2. **Copy the ENTIRE contents** as a single line (it should be one long JSON string)
  3. Paste it here
- **Environment**: Check all (Production, Preview, Development)

4. Click **"Save"** for each variable

### Option B: Using Local Development (.env.local)

1. In your project root, create a file named `.env.local`
2. Add the following:

```bash
GOOGLE_SHEET_ID=your_spreadsheet_id_here
GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY={"type":"service_account"...} # Paste entire JSON on one line
```

3. **IMPORTANT**: Never commit `.env.local` to git (it's already in .gitignore)

---

## Step 8: Initialize Your Google Sheet with Headers (Optional but Recommended)

You can add headers to your Google Sheet manually, or let the first submission create them automatically.

### Manual Method (Recommended):
1. Open your Google Sheet
2. In the first row (Row 1), add these headers:
   - A1: `Timestamp`
   - B1: `Name`
   - C1: `Email`
   - D1: `Phone`
   - E1: `Project Type`
   - F1: `Budget`
   - G1: `Timeline`
   - H1: `Message`
   - I1: `IP Address`

3. Format the headers (optional):
   - Make them bold
   - Add background color
   - Freeze the top row (View â†’ Freeze â†’ 1 row)

## Step 9: Deploy and Test

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **If testing locally:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Visit the contact form and submit a test entry

3. **Deploy to Vercel:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add Google Sheets integration"
   git push
   ```
   Vercel will automatically deploy

4. **Test the live form:**
   - Visit your deployed website
   - Fill out the contact form
   - Submit it
   - Check your Google Sheet to see the submission appear!

## Spam Protection Features Included

Your form now includes multiple spam protection mechanisms:

1. **Rate Limiting**: Maximum 3 submissions per hour per IP address
2. **Honeypot Field**: Hidden field that catches bots
3. **Email Validation**: Server-side email format validation
4. **Required Fields**: Server-side validation for required fields

---

## Troubleshooting

### "GOOGLE_SHEET_ID is not configured" error
- Check that you added the environment variable in Vercel
- Redeploy after adding environment variables

### "Failed to save to Google Sheets" in logs
- Verify the service account email has Editor access to the sheet
- Check that the GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY is valid JSON
- Make sure Google Sheets API is enabled in your Google Cloud project

### Submissions not appearing in the sheet
- Check Vercel Function logs for errors
- Verify the spreadsheet ID is correct
- Ensure the sheet is named "Sheet1" (or update the code to match your sheet name)

### Rate limiting issues during testing
- Rate limits are per IP address
- Wait 1 hour between tests, or temporarily increase the limit in `/app/api/contact/route.ts`
