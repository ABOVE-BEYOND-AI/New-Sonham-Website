2. Submit
3. Check Google Sheet for entry

### Test Rate Limiting:
1. Submit form 3 times within an hour
2. 4th submission should show error: "Too many submissions"
3. Wait 1 hour or clear rate limit in code

### Test Validation:
- Try submitting without required fields
- Try invalid email format
- All should show appropriate errors

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "GOOGLE_SHEET_ID is not configured"
- Add environment variable in Vercel
- Redeploy after adding variables

### "Failed to save to Google Sheets"
- Check service account has Editor access to sheet
- Verify GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY is valid JSON
- Ensure Google Sheets API is enabled

### No data appearing in sheet
- Check spreadsheet ID is correct
- Verify sheet name is "Sheet1" (or update code)
- Check Vercel function logs for errors

### Rate limit too strict during testing
- Edit `app/api/contact/route.ts` line 41-44
- Temporarily increase `maxRequests` to 100
- Remember to change back for production!
